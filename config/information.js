Holborn isn\'t trendy London, so no need to grow an elaborate moustache and wear a "jaunty" hat. It is still Central London however, so anyone from North of the  Watford Gap, be warned the drink prices will shock you so please come prepared with some pre-rehearsed smart comment to alert us all to this fact.'

We will most likely be starting off with Amelie\'s playlist, which is mostly 1 Direction and Little Mix. As the evening progresses we will be hearing more from my playlist, which is mostly Little Mix and 1 Direction. If you have any alternative suggestions of your own, please feel free to neatly write them on a piece of paper, pop them in an envelope, address and stamp it, then put said evelope in the bin. It is going to be 1 Direction and Little Mix, you are just going to have to deal with this fact.'

Farringdon is only 5 minutes walk from the venue and has plenty of options (especially near the Victorian meat market). Covent Garden is about 10-15 mins away and is a popular tourist location. We are also 10 minutes from the Thames so depending on the weather this also might be a nice option.'

      content: 'Although it seems logical to just say "we are on the top floor" it actually isn\'t. The building is built into the Holborn Viaduct, so depending on which street you enter by, you could be on the bottom floor or the top floor. If you are arriving via a door that has the bridge above it, you have lots of stairs to climb. If you have to cross the viaduct to get to the entrance then you are already on the right floor. Got it? no, well I tried.'
